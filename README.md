# shell-swift | Shell Implementation in Swift 

A UNIX shell implementation built in Swift, heavily inspired by the [Build your own Shell challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/shell) from CodeCrafters.

## About This Project

While CodeCrafters provides starter code for languages such as Rust, Python, and Go, it does not offer Swift support for this challenge. Therefore, I created this implementation in Swift to complete the project.

### Key Features
- Built-in commands (`echo`, `type`, `exit`)
- External program execution with PATH resolution
- Command-line argument parsing

## Running the Shell

```bash
# Build and run
swift run
```

or,

```bash
# Build and run
./your_program.sh
```
